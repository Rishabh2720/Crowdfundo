# Crowdfundo
 Its a Micro-Crowd Funding application, which acts as a middle layer between the doner and the underprivilaged.
 A Donation system for the underprivileged community, the app would be used by the donors and relatively privileged members of the community.
 They capture videos of the donation seeker, his/her case, and a clip of that privileged member who would take responsibility of collecting and donating the funds to the seeker. 
 Use of this type of app is narrowed down to one specific function and doesnt bothers for the gimmicky things.
 Its useful and helps the underprivilaged to get themselves and their idea noticed by huge group of wealthy indivisuals who'll be willing to help pan their idea into reality.
 Would have a feed for:
 1. Who's helping who and how.
 2. New ideas by people, who are working.
 3. Updates on projects and live donation count for each donee.
 4. Goals to be reached or almost reached(Counter).
 Each indivisual story donee can be created and shared(with use of NLP), on multiple platforms such as Facebook, twitter, and other social networking sites
 Features such as direct transactions through UPI payment gateways, Wallets, direct pay through cards or Net Banking, so as to minimize the effort of normal bank transfers, and send money directly to whatever ideas one is interested in and wants to help.
 
 Thus, through this app, we can create a virtual environment for people who wants to help other underprivilaged people to get their ideas up and running and allowing them to change the world for the good!
